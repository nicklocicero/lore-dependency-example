# Lore's use as a dependency management tool

You don't have to set up python environments by hand, lore does that for you.  Just lore init with your app and python version.  It will set up a requirements.txt file with pip freeze.  It's great!  Don't have to worry about everyone following the best practices every time they write Python.  Lore does it for them!
